# Iris-Dataset-Dashboard

Deployed at [Iris Dashboard](https://rish2604.shinyapps.io/iris-dataset-dashboard/) 

## Instructions to run

## To run the dashboard locally.
Simply run the `run.R` script to run the dashboard locally.

## Demo Video
The demo video is available at [Iris Dataset Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2DKSOy6UaM), which shows me interacting with the dashboard and analyzing the different graphs for the iris dataset.

## Deploy
1. Set the environment variables for your `shinyapps.io` account and the directory to be deployed.
2. Then run the `deploy.R` file

### (when faced issues during local run) Added in the setup : 
```bash
options(shiny.port = 3838)
Sys.setenv(RSTUDIO_PANDOC = "C:/Users/Rishita/AppData/Local/Pandoc")
```
